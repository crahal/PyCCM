# Demographic Research Methods and the PyCCM Library  
## Day Five: Introducing PyCCM  
**Instructors:** Charles Rahal and Jiani Yan  
**Date:** October 31, 2025  

---

### Overview

This session combines demonstrations, guided tutorials, and a short hackathon exercise designed to introduce participants to the **PyCCM** library for population projections.  

By the end of the session, participants will be able to:  
- Configure and execute population projections using **PyCCM**.  
- Understand and participate in the code review process.  
- Contribute effectively to the ongoing development of the library.

### Section 1 — Introduction to PyCCM (≈ 30 minutes)

Charles Rahal will provide an overview of **PyCCM**, explaining its modular architecture and computational workflow.  
The session will illustrate how the core components interact to produce consistent population projections.

---

### Section 2 — Code Review and Standards (≈ 15 minutes)

Jiani Yan will outline the code review process used in PyCCM development, emphasizing version control, testing conventions, and documentation practices.  
Participants will learn how to submit well-structured contributions and engage in collaborative review.

---

### Section 3 — Guided Hackathon Exercise (≈ 60 minutes)

Participants will run **PyCCM** locally by following the instructions in the `README.md` file.  
The Jupyter notebook `./src/figures_static_helper.ipynb` provides additional utilities for visualization.  

You are encouraged to modify selected `.yaml` parameter files to explore alternative projection scenarios, drawing on concepts covered earlier in this course.

### Section 4 — Contributing to PyCCM (≈ 30 minutes)

This section focuses on open contribution to the **PyCCM GitHub repository**, the primary platform for reporting bugs and proposing new features.  

Participants should raise any installation or runtime issues encountered during the hackathon.  
The instructors will review the current issue list, discuss proposed fixes, and outline the timeline for the next development cycle (PyCCM has been temporarily “frozen” in preparation for this course).

---

### Section 5 — Looking Ahead: Building a Frontend Dashboard (≈ 30 minutes)

Following the resolution of backend issues, attention will shift toward developing a **frontend dashboard** using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).  

Discussion points include:  
- How Streamlit operates and integrates with PyCCM outputs.  
- Which indicators and visualizations would best support demographic analysis.  
- The recommended structure for an interactive, modular dashboard.
